    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
        My name is Tanay Rangasamy. I am an aspiring game developer currently studying a Bachelor of Enigeering Science in Digital Arts at Wits University.
        I am proficient with multiple programming languages as well as elecronics and I have some experience in animation using 3D software such as Blender.
        I have had a passion for video games and animation since I was little and I am hoping to one day invoke that passion in others.
        I hope you enjoy your experience with Neo-Tanay!
    </p>
