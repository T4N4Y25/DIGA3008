            In this section the design process in creating Neo-Tanay is fully
            documented. Here you will see how the website grew from a simple
            wireframe concept to a fully functioning portfolio site!

        <section class="DesignIxD">
          <h2 class="p-DesignHeadingTwo">The IxD Process</h2>
          <p class="DesignParagraph">
            The IxD Process was looked at in the
            <a href="../Blogs/Blog4.html">week 4</a> blog Post and general ideas
            were put together for this.

          <section class="DesignGoal">
            <h3 class="p-DesignHeadingThree">Goal Alignment</h3>
            <p class="DesignParagraph">
              There are three major factors to look at when deciding on goal
              alignment for the website: who is the target audience? What should
              the users see and do? What is the most important and interesting
              content.
            </p>

            <ul data-list-type="goalslist">
              <li>
                The Target Audience: There are two main target audiences for the
                website, the lecturers and markers for the course as well as
                potential employers in the game design and software engineering
                fields.
              </li>
              <li>
                What should the users see and do: Considering the target
                audience the website should be presented professionally. The
                user will be presented with options to navigate different
                sections of the website which will each showcase a different
                aspect of myself or my work. The main pages to be included are a
                general homepage with an overview of the site and navigation
                options, a design section detailing the research and design
                process for creating the site, a blog post page where the user
                can find the weekly blogs done for the course, an essays page
                showcasing the two essays which will be done later in the
                course, a profile page explaining to the user who I am, a
                portfolio page showcasing some of the projects and work I have
                completed, and finally I am also including a section which will
                have a copy of my CV. The interactions for the site will mostly
                be for navigation purposes as the website is primarily to
                showcase myself.
              </li>
              <li>
                The most important and interesting content: Considering the
                users will be the lecturers and markers, the main content to be
                displayed should be the work done for the course, hence the
                essays, blog posts, and design section. Potential employers will
                also be looking at the site so the projects page will also be
                important to display, and this will most likely be the most
                interesting section of the website.

            <p class="DesignParagraph">
              Below you will be able to see a map of the information structure
              for the site listing what each page will have.
            </p>

            </figure>

            <p class="DesignParagraph">
              The user flow is designed so the user can access any page from all
              the main page sections indicated by arrows. Each block represents
              a screen for the website. The only exception is not allowing the
              user to directly access the other pages via the individual weekly
              blog posts and the individual project pages. This is to avoid to
              many links on these pages which can lead to confusion for the user
              as these pages will be information heavy and it is better to have
              a single link back to the main respective page. Main pages will
              however all have access to a common navigation bar and all pages
              will allow the user to return to the homepage.

            <h3 class="p-DesignHeadingThree">Interface Elements</h3>
            <p>
              The main interface elements will be buttons, links, scrollbars,
              control interfaces and progress bars.

            <ul data-list-type="goalslist">
              <li>
                Buttons: Buttons will be included on each weekly blog to allow
                the user to chronologically navigate the blogs. On the essays
                page a button will allow the user to seamlessly switch between
                the two essays which will be displayed on the main essay page.
              </li>
              <li>
                Links: Links will be the primary source of navigation using the
                general navigation bar. The user will be able to navigate to
                each section of the website using links on the homepage. Links
                will be included to allow the user to view a specific project on
                its own respective page via the portfolio page.
              </li>
              <li>
                Scrollbars: Scrollbars will be included on each page excluding
                the homepage and the blogs home page. This will allow the user
                to easily navigate through information heavy pages and will
                allow more components (images, media clips etc.) while retaining
                their ideal size in contrast to compressing the components to
                fit on the page.
              </li>
              <li>
                Control interfaces: For the video game projects to be displayed
                in the portfolio section of the website, a WebGL media player
                can be implemented to allow the user to directly try out the
                video game being displayed.
              </li>
              <li>
                Progress bars: This will allow the user to track how far they
                are in pages such as the weekly blogs and the projects. It will
                give the user a good idea of how much more content the pages
                have to offer.

          <p class="DesignParagraph">
            This version is safest to use as it is utilized by many websites.
            Implementing a scrollbar will also keep the website optimized when
            viewed on a phone.

          <p class="DesignParagraph">
            This design gives off more of a creative style while still looking
            professional. The navigation bar consists of icons that take the
            user to the respective page when clicked. Since many of these icons
            may not be intuitive, the bar can extend horizontally to display the
            name of each icon and hence giving the user an idea of where the
            link will take them. Another option is to have hover-over text on
            the icons with the name of the section the link will direct the user
            too.
          </p>
          <p class="DesignParagraph">
            The second option for the base UI will be approached as it is
            visually more appealing and will help display more creativity via
            the navigation bar icons in terms of the website aesthetic.

            style and should be either a mix of blues and black or purples and
            black. The font should also mimic the style of episode title cards
