                There are three major factors to look at when deciding on goal
                alignment for the website: who is the target audience? What
                should the users see and do? What is the most important and
                interesting content.
              </p>

                  <div class="p-keyword">The Target Audience:</div>
                  There are two main target audiences for the website, the
                  lecturers and markers for the course as well as potential
                  employers in the game design and software engineering fields.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <div class="p-keyword">What should the users see and do:</div>
                  Considering the target audience the website should be
                  presented professionally. The user will be presented with
                  options to navigate different sections of the website which
                  will each showcase a different aspect of myself or my work.
                  The main pages to be included are a general homepage with an
                  overview of the site and navigation options, a design section
                  detailing the research and design process for creating the
                  site, a blog post page where the user can find the weekly
                  blogs done for the course, an essays page showcasing the two
                  essays which will be done later in the course, a profile page
                  explaining to the user who I am, a portfolio page showcasing
                  some of the projects and work I have completed, and finally I
                  am also including a section which will have a copy of my CV.
                  The interactions for the site will mostly be for navigation
                  purposes as the website is primarily to showcase myself.

                  Considering the users will be the lecturers and markers, the
                  main content to be displayed should be the work done for the
                  course, hence the essays, blog posts, and design section.
                  Potential employers will also be looking at the site so the
                  projects page will also be important to display, and this will
                  most likely be the most interesting section of the website.

                The user flow is designed so the user can access any page from
                all the main page sections indicated by arrows. Each block
                represents a screen for the website. The only exception is not
                allowing the user to directly access the other pages via the
                individual weekly blog posts and the individual project pages.
                This is to avoid to many links on these pages which can lead to
                confusion for the user as these pages will be information heavy
                and it is better to have a single link back to the main
                respective page. Main pages will however all have access to a
                common navigation bar and all pages will allow the user to
                return to the homepage.

                  each section of the website using links on the homepage. Links
                  will be included to allow the user to view a specific project

                  easily navigate through information heavy pages and will allow
                  more components (images, media clips etc.) while retaining
                  their ideal size in contrast to compressing the components to
                  fit on the page.

                  This will allow the user to track how far they are in pages
                  such as the weekly blogs and the projects. It will give the
                  user a good idea of how much more content the pages have to
                  offer.

                The inclusion of JavaScript allows for updates within the IxD

              This version is safest to use as it is utilized by many websites.
              Implementing a scrollbar will also keep the website optimized when

              This design gives off more of a creative style while still looking
              professional. The navigation bar consists of icons that take the
              user to the respective page when clicked. Since many of these
              icons may not be intuitive, the bar can extend horizontally to
              display the name of each icon and hence giving the user an idea of
              where the link will take them. Another option is to have
              hover-over text on the icons with the name of the section the link
              will direct the user too.

              this style and should be either a mix of blues and black or
              purples and black. The font should also mimic the style of episode

                One key update is to the base UI is a move towards a simpler
                structure primarily consisting of a header (the navigation bar),
                the page content, and a footer which assists in navigation
                clarity. An example of how the footer will be used is in showing
                how many sections there are to a page, for example the home page
                has four page cards the user can scroll through. If the user is
                on the first page card, the footer will represent this as page
                1/4 and so forth. The blog pages will differ slightly in terms
                of the footer due to the inclusion of a progress bar which will
                show the user how many blogs they have read.

              The main goal and aesthetic are to invoke a 90s anime-style city

              This would mean having a primarily dark look to the website
              contrasted heavily by bright text and icons like a city at night

              The fonts I initially wanted to use were not available on Google

              The visual design elements I choose need to incorporate the
              feeling of a retro anime-style city. I have chosen several design
              choices to help encompass this aesthetic:
            </p>
            <ul data-list-type="goalslist">
              <li>
                Neon lines for borders around cards that take the user to a
                certain page (making these borders flicker can add to the
                aesthetic).
              </li>
              <li>
                Scanlines over the website (commonly seen in 90s anime and VHS
                tapes) for a nostalgic feeling.
              </li>
              <li>
                Simple icons for the navigation bar to each relevant page.
                Hover-over text will explain what each icon represents.
              </li>
              <li>
                Buttons will look like signs therefore square with a background
                colour contrasting the main text colour. They will also appear
                elevated with a shadow behind them to create a 3D effect. The
                font will flicker between white and the main neon blue/purple
                colour when a cursor hovers over the button to indicate
                interactivity.
              </li>
              <li>
                Building images will represent the page cards that can take the
                user to the various pages.
              </li>
              <li>
                A logo representing the website in the Navigation Bar (logo will
                be in the main colour of the site – Neon Blue).

              <p class="DesignParagraph">
                The style guide held up quite well with only a few minor changes
                needed such as a change to the background colour (changed from
                black to a transparent navy blue - #050514F2) as the black
                background contrasted to heavily with the white text and caused
                eye-strain.
              </p>
              <p class="DesignParagraph">
                The homepage style also changed due to the ability to create
                effects with JavaScript. Instead of a gif that plays as the
                background for the homepage, a rain effect will be created using
                JavaScript to keep the background colour consistent across all
                pages while still pertaining to the late-night city theme.
              </p>
              <p class="DesignParagraph">
                The navigation bar will no longer consist of icons acting as the
                links as these icons are not intuitive to users. Instead simple
                text will act as the links allowing for the user to know where
                they are going at a first glance.
              </p>

              <p class="DesignParagraph">
                The two fonts used - Audiowide and Barlow both work very well
                together and are consistent with the theme. Audiowide can become
                illegible if used in paragraphs so this font will be reserved
                specifically for main headings and card titles. Barlow is a
                legible font and will be used for the paragraph text, however
                the text being white can become illegible when appearing in a
                paragraph so a gap of around 2px-5px will be implemented to help
                make the text more legible.
              </p>
              <p class="DesignParagraph">
                To help contain paragraphs within sections such as essays and
                blogs, a thin, white border will be placed around the text to
                negate empty space created by margins. Text will be left-aligned
                but the main body of text will be centred to prevent the user
                from needing to read from one end of the screen to the other.

              The luminous purple borders around each image will flicker,

              specific image to add more interactivity and feedback for the
              user. This will also make the page card the user is hovering over
              stand out more using the Similarity and Difference effect which
              can help entice users to visit the page.

              The Next blog and Previous blog button may be moved to the sides
              of the progress bar as these two interface elements along with the
              progress bar can help implement the Serial Position Effect (last
              items are remembered). The progress bar provides a good
              opportunity for implementing the UX design principle where
              uncompleted tasks are remembered. This will allow the user to
              better identify their progress through the blog readings and will
              promote them to continue reading through the subsequent blogs. The
              colour white (#ffffff) is predominantly used on the blog pages due
              to the large quantity of reading done and this colour can reduce
              eye strain compared to the brighter and neon colours.
