    <h1>The Design Process</h1>
    <p>
        In this section the design process in creating Neo-Tanay is fully documented. 
        Here you will see how the website grew from a simple wireframe concept to a fully functioning portfolio site!
    </p>
    <h2>The IxD Process</h2>
    <p>
        The IxD Process was looked at in the <a href = ../Blogs/Blog4.html>week 4</a> blog Post and general ideas were put together for this. 
    </p>
    <h3>Goal Alignment</h3>
    <p>
        There are three major factors to look at when deciding on goal alignment for the website: who is the target audience? What should the users see and do? What is the most important and interesting content.  
        <ul>
            <li>	The Target Audience: There are two main target audiences for the website, the lecturers and markers for the course as well as potential employers in the game design and software engineering fields. </li>
            <li>	What should the users see and do: Considering the target audience the website should be presented professionally.  The user will be presented with options to navigate different sections of the website which will each showcase a different aspect of myself or my work. The main pages to be included are a general homepage with an overview of the site and navigation options, a design section detailing the research and design process for creating the site, a blog post page where the user can find the weekly blogs done for the course, an essays page showcasing the two essays which will be done later in the course, a profile page explaining to the user who I am, a portfolio page showcasing some of the projects and work I have completed, and finally I am also including a section which will have a copy of my CV. The interactions for the site will mostly be for navigation purposes as the website is primarily to showcase myself. </li>
            <li>	The most important and interesting content: Considering the users will be the lecturers and markers, the main content to be displayed should be the work done for the course, hence the essays, blog posts, and design section. Potential employers will also be looking at the site so the projects page will also be important to display, and this will most likely be the most interesting section of the website. </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Information Structure</h3>
    <p>Below you will be able to see a map of the information structure for the site listing what each page will have.</p>
    <img src = ../Images/DesignImages/InformationStructure.jpg alt = "Information Structure of the Website" width = "500" height="500">

    <h3>User Flow</h3>
    <img src = ../Images/DesignImages/UserFlow.jpg alt = "User flow diagram of the Website" width = "700" height = "500">
    <p>
        The user flow is designed so the user can access any page from all the main page sections indicated by arrows. Each block represents a screen for the website. The only exception is not allowing the user to directly access the other pages via the individual weekly blog posts and the individual project pages. This is to avoid to many links on these pages which can lead to confusion for the user as these pages will be information heavy and it is better to have a single link back to the main respective page. Main pages will however all have access to a common navigation bar and all pages will allow the user to return to the homepage. 
    </p>
    <h3>Interface Elements</h3>
    <p>
        The main interface elements will be buttons, links, scrollbars, control interfaces and progress bars. 
        <ul>
            <li>Buttons: Buttons will be included on each weekly blog to allow the user to chronologically navigate the blogs. On the essays page a button will allow the user to seamlessly switch between the two essays which will be displayed on the main essay page. </li>
            <li>Links: Links will be the primary source of navigation using the general navigation bar. The user will be able to navigate to each section of the website using links on the homepage. Links will be included to allow the user to view a specific project on its own respective page via the portfolio page.</li>
            <li>Scrollbars: Scrollbars will be included on each page excluding the homepage and the blogs home page. This will allow the user to easily navigate through information heavy pages and will allow more components (images, media clips etc.) while retaining their ideal size in contrast to compressing the components to fit on the page.</li>
            <li>Control interfaces: For the video game projects to be displayed in the portfolio section of the website, a WebGL media player can be implemented to allow the user to directly try out the video game being displayed.</li>
            <li>Progress bars: This will allow the user to track how far they are in pages such as the weekly blogs and the projects. It will give the user a good idea of how much more content the pages have to offer. </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

<h2>Style Process </h2>
<p>
    The original wire frame was shown in the<a href = ../Blogs/Blog3.html> week 3 blog</a> and is also shown below:
</p>
<img src = ../Images/WireFrame1.jpg alt = "The initial wireframe for the website" width = "500" height = "500">
<p>
    Rough Wire Frames for the base UI were further explored in the <a href = ../Blogs/Blog4.html >week 4 blog</a>. The wire frames for the base UI have been worked on for better UX and UI and are shown below:
</p>
<p>Navigation Bar options:</p>
<p>Option 1</p>
<img src = ../Images/DesignImages/BaseUI_1.jpg alt = "Option 1 of the base UI design." width = "1000" height=  "600" >
<p>This version is safest to use as it is utilized by many websites. Implementing a scrollbar will also keep the website optimized when viewed on a phone.</p>
<p>Option 2:</p>
<img src = ../Images/DesignImages/BaseUI_2.jpg alt = "Option 2 of the base UI design." width = "1000" height = "600">
<p>
    This design gives off more of a creative style while still looking professional. The navigation bar consists of icons that take the user to the respective page when clicked. Since many of these icons may not be intuitive, the bar can extend horizontally to display the name of each icon and hence giving the user an idea of where the link will take them. Another option is to have hover-over text on the icons with the name of the section the link will direct the user too. 
</p>
<p>
    The second option for the base UI will be approached as it is visually more appealing and will help display more creativity via the navigation bar icons in terms of the website aesthetic. 
</p>
<p>The blog UI will be as follows:</p>
<img src = ../Images/DesignImages/BlogUI.jpg alt = "An overview of how the blogs page will look" width = "700" height = "500">

<hr>

<p>
    I want the general style of the website to mimic the aesthetic of a vintage nighttime city skyline best represented by 90s anime cartoons and movies. The colour choices should therefore match this style and should be either a mix of blues and black or purples and black. The font should also mimic the style of episode title cards from these 90s anime series to better express the theme.
</p>
<img src = ../Images/DesignImages/ColourFont.jpg alt = "Brainstorming the colour palette and font for the website." width = "700" height = "500">
<img src = ../Images/DesignImages/Icons.jpg alt = "Brainstorming the icon and interface elements." width = "700" height = "500">

<hr>

<h2>Reference Material</h2>
<p>The main reference used for the websites layout and design is the IGN website due its intuitive and easy to use design.</p>
<img src = ../Images/DesignImages/IGN.jpg alt = "Example of the IGN homepage." width = "1000" height="550">

<p>
    The theme and colour palette comes from various 90s aesthetic anime visuals to properly give off the beautiful and mysterious aesthetic of a nighttime city. 
</p>
<img src = ../Images/DesignImages/ColourRef.jpg alt = "First reference for the aesthetic of the website" height = "700" width = "400">
<img src = ../Images/DesignImages/ColourRef2.jpg alt = "Second reference for the aesthetic of the website" height = "500" width = "650">
<img src = ../Images/DesignImages/ColourRef3.jpg alt = "Third reference for the aesthetic of the website" height = "500" width = "650">
