              Critical Reflection on "Digital inequalities and why they matter"
              by Robinson
            </h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Before I begin the reflection, I would like to point out that all
              quotes used in this critical reflection come from the text
              "Digital inequalities and why they matter" by Robinson, 2015.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              "The relationship between digital inequalities and other forms of
              inequality has yet to be fully appreciated" seems to indicate that
              despite the rapidly growing digital divide caused by the expansion
              of the internet, the digital divide remains unnoticed compared to
              other forms of inequality. By opening the text with this
              statement, the author is giving a brief overview of what the text
              will entail: the growing concern of digital inequality.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              The author continues by describing the traditional forms of
              inequality: race, class and gender. The author then explains that
              digital inequality is still relatively new and therefore is going
              unnoticed despite its rapid growth. Digital inequality is a
              growing concern as those with more access to the internet and
              digital services are more likely to succeed as "digital capital
              play key roles in a range of outcomes, from academic performance
              to labour market success to entrepreneurship to health services
              uptake." This point is true when one looks at how rapidly the
              world is transitioning from an offline community to an online
              community where most interactions now occur online. Those who do
              not have access to the internet and digital services are therefore
              left behind and do not have access to the opportunities that the
              internet provides. The author then explains that even without the
              advantages of online capital, "digital inequalities can reinforce
              existing social inequalities and even exacerbate them because they
              carry over preexisting differences in human capital into online
              settings." This is a valid theory as humans as a species tend to
              fixate on the differences between each other and use these
              differences as an excuse for prejudice. Historically humans have
              demonstrated the severity of inequality by creating division
              according to race, class and gender. These prejudices are in the
              process of being ruled out of society and steps are being taken to
              ensure that; however, access to the internet has provided people a
              worldwide platform to farther spread inequality and prejudice
              towards others mostly free of consequence (insulting someone
              in-person can have immediate consequences but doing it online is
              relatively risk free).
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              The author further emphasises the unfair advantages that digital
              capital provides by using the youth as an example. "Institutions
              demand that youths engage with online resources, youths lacking
              adequate access are compelled to ration their screen time, often
              depriving them of opportunities to develop the kinds of valuable
              web skills which their less constrained peers enjoy." This quote
              shows a direct consequence of digital divide where institutions
              expect all children to have access to the digital world. This
              however can leave those lacking basic access to the internet
              further behind as they are therefore more excluded academically
              hence institutes unknowingly prioritise education in those more
              fortunate in the digital divide. The incorporation of the internet
              into work life also allows for people to become more easily
              distracted by content provided by the internet. Therefore, those
              who are more accustomed to the flow of digital information will be
              able to function more effectively in a workspace. The elderly are
              also affected by the digital divide as those who are not
              well-acquainted with the internet lose out on the opportunity to
              connect with family and friends remotely.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Gender differences have diminished with the introduction of the
              internet; however, men do use the internet more frequently than
              women creating a larger gap in the digital divide between men and
              women. The author explains by stating that women use the internet
              for simpler tasks like communication and support, but women also
              seem to underestimate their online skills. This is interesting as
              I have personally seen no large differences between men and women
              in terms of online skills, but this could be due to my environment
              as I am surrounded by both men and women who demonstrate the same
              competence of online skills. The author then uses analytics to
              show the divide in men and women in IT industries – however this
              could not necessarily be due to digital inequality but rather
              differing interests as men are seen to use the internet more than
              women (generally) and this larger interest could promote men to
              pursue careers in these industries.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Race and ethnicity relating to digital inequality is explored
              using two hypotheses: stratification (the adoption of the internet
              "replicates existing social inequalities, as digitally mediated
              networks replicate offline social network structures and because
              offline human capital carries over to the online world") and
              normalization/diversification ("individuals can transform their
              social networks and social capital by accessing online networks").
              Stratification explores the concept that individuals who do not
              have the resources to access online networks will not be able to
              benefit from online capital further creating a divide between
              those with access and those without. Normalization contrasts this
              by explaining that the introduction of the internet has allowed
              people to gain access to resources they were not able to access
              previously.
