            <h2 class="p-SubHeading">Design Section for the Website</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
              The initial design idea for the website includes a home page, an
              essays page, a blog page, a design page, a projects page, an
              introduction page to myself and a page hosting my CV.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              The homepage currently only has the navigation links to the other
              pages. These links are listed under each other currently but
              according to the design they need to be vertical and on the left
              side of the homepage. A title and logo for the website is still
              being decided upon to get a general theme for the homepage and the
              website in general; however, this will only be important when
              styling and JavaScript is implemented. The right side of the
              website homepage will have images that can act as links to
              priority pages (essays, blogs, design and projects). Further
              research is being done in regard to how to achieve this, but I am
              assuming that to get the proper layout I want I will require
              styling and JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              The blog page is the most developed aspect of the website due to
              the weekly additions to the blog discussion board. The pages can
              be traversed using buttons which currently go to the previous and
              next page. The navigation menu still needs to be added to this
              section to allow the user to traverse back to the home page or to
              any of the other relevant pages.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              The design section has images of the wireframe ideas and some text
              explaining the concepts for the design. More will be added to this
              section when the wireframe soon becomes expanded upon.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              The projects page currently has screenshots of the different Game
              Design projects worked on last year with the project’s titles. The
              goal is to have media clips with short demonstrations act as the
              main thumbnail for these projects and ultimately, I want to be
              able to make sections playable in the browser by possibly using
              WebGL in Unity. More projects from other courses will be added to
              the projects page as development continues.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              The information page has text explaining a little bit about myself
              accompanied by a suitable picture. Similarly, the CV page will
              have my CV typed out on the webpage.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              The essays page is currently blank as we have not done any essays
              yet. However, if I can find essays from previous years, I will be
              able add these to the essays page (the essays page will function
              similarly to the blogs page). The designs that I still need to do
              is adding the navigation bar to each page as well as ensuring the
              title or logo of the website is prevalent on each page.

          <section class="IxDParagraph">
            <h2 class="p-SubHeading">The IxD Process</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
              The IxD Process is as follows: goal alignment, information
              structure, user flow, interface elements, design and
              implementation.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              The goal alignment is essentially what I want the user to see and
              do with the website. The target audience for the website is of
              course the lecturers marking the website but also potential
              employers. Therefore, the website should be relatively
              professional while still showcasing enough creativity to give the
              viewer a good idea of what kind of person I am. Since the main
              audience currently is the markers, the main content should be the
              work done in class (the blog posts, essays and design section).
              Since potential employers will also be viewing this website the
              projects section should also be emphasized as this section will be
              the primary highlight of my skills.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              The information structure should map out the website. Therefore,
              the homepage should give a brief overview of the website while
              delivering the appropriate tone and visual aesthetic to the site
              so the user will have a good overview of what to expect. The
              homepage will primarily be used for navigation hence a navigation
              bar with all the possible pages to visit will be available. This
              navigation bar will help make the website more accessible so it
              will be included on each page in the website (with an option to
              expand or reduce it). Some of the pages (mentioned in goals) will
              be prioritized by having a section next to the navigation bar with
              animated images. Clicking on these images will take the user to
              the respective page. The blog page will have a broad overview of
              the blog and links to the respective blogs according to the tree
              hierarchy. Each blog will include a button that takes the user to
              the next or previous blog and a button at the top to take the user
              back to the main blog page (law of locality).
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              The essays page will have fewer entries than the blog page;
              therefore, the user will be taken straight to the first essay from
              the essay link. A button will be included for navigation between
              the essays.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              The information and CV pages will simply be a page like any word
              document with minimal interaction components as these pages are
              simply for more information. The design page will also follow suit
              as this page gives clarity on the design process for the website
              already discussed via the blog posts. The projects page will have
              a list of each project organized vertically with the best project
              being at the top (serial position effect). There will be a short
              media clip that the user can view to get an overview of the
              project. Hopefully the page will also include WebGL links so that
              the user will be able to play some of the projects directly
              through the website.

            <p class="paragraph">
              To incorporate proper design principles multiple approaches are
              taken accordingly. On the home page each of the main page links
              will encompass an animated image relating to the page. This way
              each of these pages will make the user think that the pages are
              interesting and will be more enticed to view each page. The user
              input on each page is kept relatively simple to buttons and
              scrollbars to avoid complexity hence keeping the website simple
              and easy to navigate. Since the navigation bar by the logo of the
              website is a key aspect for the user to traverse the website, it
              is kept in the top right corner of each page to ensure the user
              will always remember it as an option to traverse the site. The
              blog page is organised using a tree structure to allow easier
              access to each of the blogs compared to starting at the first blog
              and needing to traverse through each blog to reach the desired
              page. Each page has an overview under the title explaining the
              content of each page, so the user has a clear understanding of
              what they are viewing. The website design took inspiration from
              sites such as IGN and some of the past students work.

              The initial wireframe changed a lot upon learning more about the
              IxD process and each page is now more developed to correspond to
              intuitive and accessible UX and UI.

          <section class="ReflectionParagraph">
            <h2 class="p-SubHeading">Reflection on Website 1</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
              The Website developed smoothly as all the HTML concepts needed
              were explored and demonstrated in class in conjunction with MDN
              Web Docs. The only issues that arose were more in the overall
              presentation, but these issues will be fixed when CSS and
              JavaScript are more thoroughly explored. Issue I am yet to resolve
              is creating the collapsable navigation menu, aligning everything
              according to the wireframe design and having the Logo appear on
              each page. These issues will hopefully be resolved in time for the
              assignment submission.
