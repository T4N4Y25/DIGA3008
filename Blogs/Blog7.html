            <p class="paragraph">
              When finding a South African website to do an analysis on, I find
              that using an evidently bad website is better compared to using a
              good website. This makes the analysis easier as it is very evident
              where the shortcomings on the website are. Therefore, with this in
              mind what better website to use than any website from the South
              African Government.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Website examples I will consider include:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The South African Government page (South African Government,
                n.d. South African Government. [online] Available at:
                https://www.gov.za/ [Accessed 25 Mar. 2025]).
              </li>
              <li>
                The National Traffic Information System page (NaTIS, n.d.
                National Traffic Information System. [online] Available at:
                https://www.natis.gov.za/ [Accessed 25 Mar. 2025]).
              </li>
              <li>
                And just to have a good website to look at, the H&M page (H&M,
                n.d. H&M South Africa. [online] Available at:
                https://www.hm.com/za/ [Accessed 14 Apr. 2025]).
              </li>

            <p class="paragraph">
              From first glance there are many things wrong with this website:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                There are too many choices on the homepage violating one of the
                key UX principles.
              </li>
              <li>
                Every tab and link are visually similar with the only different
                icon being this “In Focus” section which doesn’t seem important
                enough to justify it’s use (misuse of isolation effect).
              </li>
              <li>
                Each link below the main tabs are just that-links and there’s
                too many of them in an unorganized sense.
              </li>
              <li>
                Each page for the relevant tabs listed consist of only links.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="paragraph">
              The website does do some things write though:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Good colour palette.</li>
              <li>Intuitive icons</li>
              <li>Simple navigation bar</li>
              <li>
                The tabs for the relevant pages are kept simple demonstrating
                good UI principles.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="paragraph">Cons:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Immediately I was confused as to how to navigate the site.
                Nothing in the navigation bar seemed to have any relevance to
                the site.
              </li>
              <li>
                The only standout element is an image which is not interactable.
              </li>
              <li>
                There is nothing on the home page you can interact with besides
                some links at the footer.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="paragraph">Pros:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Simple colour palette consisting of just primary colours.</li>
            </ul>

          <section class="handm">
            <h2 class="p-SubHeading">H&M</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Pros:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Simple homepage.</li>
              <li>Intuitive icons.</li>
              <li>
                Good colour palette consisting of mostly red, white and black.
              </li>
              <li>
                The site serves to sell clothes. The images are large and differ
                from the usual colour scheme demonstrating good UX principles.
                The images are also links to the relevant sections of the menu.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="paragraph">Cons:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Some confusion on where to go from the homepage.</li>

  <h2 class="p-SubHeading">Investigation into UI and UX Analysis</h2>

  <p class="paragraph"><strong>Writing the Introduction</strong><br>
    The introduction to an essay should incorporate three concepts:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Background:</strong> Aims to attract reader attention on the topic and should have supporting information from academic sources. One to three sentences.</li>
    <li><strong>Thesis Statement:</strong> Theory that is proven in the body of the essay. Articulates key aim and arguments of the essay. Should answer the question, “So what?” to promote the reader to continue the essay. Treats the topic of the essay in depth (hence requires research into the topic).</li>
    <li><strong>Essay outline:</strong> One to two sentences explaining how the thesis is going to be addressed sequentially in the body. “This essay will discuss…then…followed by the conclusion and recommendations.”</li>
  </ol>

  <p class="paragraph">Hence the general outline for the essay will be as follows: background statement, thesis statement, and the essay outline.</p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    The essay involves ethics, interaction design, UI and UX. The analysis of the essay should speak about the ethics of the interaction design which is structured through UI and UX.
  </p>

  <h3>General Structure</h3>
  <p class="paragraph">Discuss the UI and UX elements of the website and hence how the interaction design is structured.</p>

  <p class="paragraph"><strong>UI will be discussed first:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Intuitive, simplified, consistent.</li>
    <li>Familiarity</li>
    <li>Proper navigation (user is not lost when navigating).</li>
    <li>Correct hierarchy (page layout, colour, size, font, negative space)</li>
    <li>Flexible on multiple devices.</li>
    <li>Legible font and good information arrangement.</li>
    <li>Information hierarchy (top should answer questions user may have).</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="paragraph"><strong>Then the UX principles will be discussed:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Similarity and Difference effect.</li>
    <li>Simplified choices.</li>
    <li>Uncompleted/Interrupted tasks effect.</li>
    <li>Time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.</li>
    <li>Serial position effect.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="paragraph"><strong>Define ethics in the context of the web.</strong></p>
  <p class="paragraph"><strong>Discuss each principle of ethical web design:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Usability</li>
    <li>Privacy</li>
    <li>Security</li>
    <li>Transparency</li>
    <li>Accessibility</li>
    <li>Inclusion</li>
    <li>Ethical Persuasion</li>
    <li>Influence</li>
    <li>Safety</li>
    <li>Sustainability</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="paragraph"><strong>Discuss deceptive patterns spotted:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Comparison Prevention</li>
    <li>Confirm-shaming</li>
    <li>Disguised Ads</li>
    <li>Fake scarcity</li>
    <li>Fake social proof</li>
    <li>Fake urgency</li>
    <li>Forced action</li>
    <li>Hard to cancel</li>
    <li>Hidden costs</li>
    <li>Hidden subscription</li>
    <li>Nagging</li>
    <li>Obstruction</li>
    <li>Pre-selection</li>
    <li>Sneaking</li>
    <li>Trick wording</li>
    <li>Visual interference</li>
  </ul>
