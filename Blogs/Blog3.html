            This week we took a broader look at user alignment through the
            concept of Interaction Design. The URL structure of my website
            therefore needs to be simple to use (such as through only clicking
            on icons and links), it needs to be visually appealing with good
            images and maybe even some animations, and finally the website
            structure in html needs to be well organised for easier maintenance
            and updates.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph">
            The website will consist of a collapsable navigation menu where the
            user will be able to access all the available pages of the site. The
            menu full size will only take up a portion of the screen but can be
            collapsed so the user can view the page they are currently on
            better. The menu will be the user’s main navigation procedure
            through the site. The site will consist of seven different pages:
            the home page, the blog page, the design page, the projects page, a
            page detailing some information about me and a page with my CV. The
            main goal of the website is therefore to act a portfolio piece for
            me allowing me to demonstrate my skills and interests to potential
            job postings. The home page will have animated graphics with links
            to the main pages of the website (The essays, blogs, design and
            projects pages). Clicking on these graphics will take the user to
            the relevant page. The blogs page will have a button icon which will
            allow the user to traverse through the different blogs. The same
            will be done for the essays page to allow easier navigation of the
            documents. The project page will have clips of each of the Game
            Design projects as well as any other prominent projects to display
            to the user on this page.

            This week progress was made with the project. The basic navigation
            and pages were setup and images were added to the various pages.
