    Week 3 (24/02/2025 – 28/02/2025)

        This week we took a broader look at user alignment through the concept of Interaction Design. The URL structure of my website therefore needs to be simple to use (such as through only clicking on icons and links), it needs to be visually appealing with good images and maybe even some animations, and finally the website structure in html needs to be well organised for easier maintenance and updates.

        The website will consist of a collapsable navigation menu where the user will be able to access all the available pages of the site. The menu full size will only take up a portion of the screen but can be collapsed so the user can view the page they are currently on better. The menu will be the user’s main navigation procedure through the site. The site will consist of seven different pages: the home page, the blog page, the design page, the projects page, a page detailing some information about me and a page with my CV. The main goal of the website is therefore to act a portfolio piece for me allowing me to demonstrate my skills and interests to potential job postings. The home page will have animated graphics with links to the main pages of the website (The essays, blogs, design and projects pages). Clicking on these graphics will take the user to the relevant page. The blogs page will have a button icon which will allow the user to traverse through the different blogs. The same will be done for the essays page to allow easier navigation of the documents. The project page will have clips of each of the Game Design projects as well as any other prominent projects to display to the user on this page.

        This week progress was made with the project. The basic navigation and pages were setup and images were added to the various pages.
