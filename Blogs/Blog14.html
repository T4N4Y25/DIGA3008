            Justice and Ethics in programming practices
          </h2>

          <p class="paragraph">
            Justice and ethics become more of a essential topic within
            programming spaces as the world continues to transition to a digital
            space. As a programmer, I come to the realization that I have a lot
            of control within this digital space, and with such freedom I must
            also be more thoughtful as to what I put out there. Everything that
            gets put onto the web should match the criteria of being ethical,
            inclusive and sustainable (Okoye, 2024).
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            One approach to correctly incorporate justice and ethics is to have
            a good understanding of ethics themselves within digital spaces.
            From the course curriculum I know the various deceptive design
            patterns which is fundamental to avoid doing these design patterns
            within my own programs.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Inclusivity is also important to help move away from colonialism in
            the digital space. By representing my culture and identity as a
            South African citizen within my programs, I can bring a broader
            awareness to South Africa as a whole.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Key points which help in ethical programming are as follows:
            prioritize user’s safety and privacy, ensure there is no bias
            towards certain groups within the program, ensure the program is
            well optimized, make the program highly accessible to those with
            disabilities, remove any language barriers and show transparency to
            the user on how their data is being used (Okoye, 2024).
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            One emphasized point on design justice that I have frequently seen
            throughout the course is the concept of the digital divide and the
            consequences of this divide. Therefore, the digital divide should be
            something constantly thought of when creating a program. Due to the
            limited resources available in certain locations, the program should
            always be optimized to account for this, for example, the lack of
            access to mobile networks and Wi-Fi can make getting online very
            difficult; to counter this, an offline option can be available to
            minimize the need for ICT resources.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            With all the benefits of the internet, there is also opportunity for
            malicious individuals to misuse the internet. When creating a
            program, security should be vital whenever a user’s personal
            information is used to prevent the risk of their information being
            misused by someone else. To help establish confidence in the
            program, it is also important to be transparent with the user to
            help reassure them that their data is being handled safely.
