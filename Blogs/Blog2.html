            The reading done for this week is “You Say You Want a Revolution?
            Hypertext and the Laws of Media (1991)” by Moulthrop, 2003. The
            concept of hypertext is a replacement for television as a new means
            for consuming information. A concern is that larger media networks
            such as Yahoo!, CNN.com MSNBC will dominate this spread of
            information compared to the initial vision of hypertext being open
            to the public. Thinking about the internet of today, hypertext has
            become engrained in our everyday lives. The concerns about corporate
            control over hypertext has also become a reality as almost all the
            media we consume is spread through social media platforms like
            Facebook, YouTube, and more; all of which are owned by larger
            corporations which profit from these media platforms. Media has
            therefore become a means for media companies to generate revenue
            where a hierarchy controls the flow of information (media
            platforms). Looking at this, many of the concerns by Moulthrop have
            inevitably become a reality.
