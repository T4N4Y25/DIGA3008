<h1> Week 2 (17/02/2025 – 21/02/2025)</h1>

        The reading done for this week is “You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media (1991)” by Moulthrop, 2003.
        The concept of hypertext is a replacement for television as a new means for consuming information. 
        A concern is that larger media networks such as Yahoo!, CNN.com MSNBC will dominate this spread of information compared to the initial vision of hypertext being open to the public. 
        Thinking about the internet of today, hypertext has become engrained in our everyday lives. 
        The concerns about corporate control over hypertext has also become a reality as almost all the media we consume is spread through social media platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and more; all of which are owned by larger corporations which profit from these media platforms. 
        Media has therefore become a means for media companies to generate revenue where a hierarchy controls the flow of information (media platforms). 
        Looking at this, many of the concerns by Moulthrop have inevitably become a reality.
