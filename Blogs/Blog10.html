              A close reading is done on the text, "How Geography Shapes—and Is
              Shaped by—the Internet" by Shane Greenstein, Chris Forman, and Avi
              Goldfarb.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              The reading aims to explore how geographical locations can affect
              how the internet is implemented as well as seeing how the internet
              has affected the economy through three key aspects: communication
              costs, transportation costs as well as search costs. The reading
              explores how a geographic location affects how the internet
              implements these three factors and hence how the internet is more
              beneficial in some regions compared to others.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              The reading uses previous events that the internet had on the
              economy through these three factors. A "re-structuring"
              (Greenstein, 2018) of multiple industries occurred due to the
              introduction of the internet to better utilize the reduction in
              communication costs, transportation costs and search costs.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Communication costs are said to be significantly lower using the
              internet as it costs almost nothing to communicate through the
              internet regardless of the user's location. (Greenstein, 2018).
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Transportation costs have been reduced due to the internet using
              the example of newspapers. In the past people needed to pay to
              have newspapers and hence local information delivered to them;
              however, the introduction of the internet has made information
              widely available to the public free of charge-hence emphasizing
              how the internet has reduced "distribution costs" (Greenstein,
              2018). It is further seen that the use of the internet has allowed
              users to receive goods without the need to travel to a physical
              store or location further reducing transportation costs. This
              reduction in transportation costs is unequal however as more rural
              locations may lack the proper infrastructure to take advantage of
              the delivery of goods and information.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Due to the reduction in communication and transportation, economic
              models have shown that this reduction directly reduces search
              costs (Greenstein, 2018). With reduced communication and
              transportation costs, it is easier to make choices as the ability
              to compare options is enhanced. Similarly, businesses can now more
              easily hire and outsource work (Greenstein, 2018).
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Various models are used in this reading to explore how the
              internet reduces the importance of certain geographical factors.
              The first model the reading examines is the "death of distance"
              model (Greenstein, 2018). This model explores the concept of
              cities losing relevance as the internet grows due to more reliance
              on the internet for communication, transportation and searching
              therefore making the need for "offline channels" more irrelevant
              (Greenstein, 2018). Geographical location has relevance according
              to this model as to incorporate the internet more into the
              economy, a highly developed structure to support this will be
              required; however, less developed locations will still have a
              larger reliance on offline channels creating a more unequal divide
              between the developed locations and the less developed locations.
              Implementing the internet requires "complementary inputs such as
              broadband service or expertise in implementing IT systems"
              (Greenstein, 2018) which less developed locations may lack. Kolko,
              Moss and Townsend (domain name registrations) show that the
              availability of the requirements to implement the internet, grows
              with location size (Greenstein, 2018).
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              A literature details two views on the internets impact on
              societies: convergence and divergence (Greenstein, 2018).
              Convergence suggests that the internet provides more employment
              opportunities to less populated regions while divergence suggests
              that the internet only benefits largely populated regions with an
              already skilled population. Evidence has been provided in the
              reading supporting both views; however, the evidence provided
              mostly suggests that divergence is the impact the internet is
              having on society.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              The reading suggests that due to the lower costs of communication
              due to the internet, innovation can occur more. By making
              communication more accessible, more collaboration can occur, hence
              increasing the innovation. According to this quote from the
              reading, "While invention became more geographically concentrated
              over this period, this is not true for the counties that were
              leaders in business Internet adoption", the application of the
              internet favours convergence regarding the two views on the
              internet's impact on society (divergence and convergence).
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Evidence has been provided on how the application of the internet
              has led to cheaper goods and more convenience (Greenstein, 2018).
              The reduction in distribution costs can lead to improvements in
              less developed locations as well as providing a larger variety of
              products. The geographic location of a user can however alter
              which stores and products they view more relevant to their
              location which can limit the user's choice regarding quality.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              "Trade in goods is likely to increase because of lower search and
              communication costs, while trade in services is likely to increase
              even more because transportation costs also fall through digital
              distribution." This quote is supported by relevant evidence and
              studies and makes sense from a first-glance perspective as
              businesses will be able to better coordinate their services and
              will be more widely available to the public through use of the
              internet.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              The reading concludes by confirming that the use of the internet
              has indeed impacted the economy by reducing costs in
              communication, transportation and searching. Three more factors
              further influence the utilization of the internet according to
              geographic location: "preferences, the availability of
              substitutes, and the availability of complements." (Greenstein,
              2018). Overall, the reading provided sufficient evidence
              supporting the claims made - regarding the impact of the
              geographic location on the use of the internet - using models,
              historical events and data, and relevant examples.
