              The reading by Daniolou discusses why we need online resources in our modern society and how a lack of access to these resources can lead to a divide in society (Daniolou, 2020). 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              A large margin of diversity is lacking from the internet due to the isolation of rural areas from the internet (Daniolou, 2020). Reassurance is then provided detailing actions taken towards incorporating these isolated societies into the modern era by providing access to online resources. The internet has proven to be beneficial to the economy, therefore providing access to the internet in these rural areas can prove beneficial. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              The internet plays a role in connecting people by eliminating distance. Through connecting people, society benefits even more from the internet by allowing people to help each other in dire situations, allowing wide access to information, and is widely used by businesses (Daniolou, 2020). 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              The use of the internet also poses risks when it is misused such as the spread of misinformation, spreading prejudice against other societies and cultures, creating divides between those who have access to the internet and those who do not, and a lack of education regarding to how to properly use the internet can propagate misuse (Daniolou, 2018). Examples of the internet being used is the spread of hatred towards certain religions such as Islam, termed 'Islamphobia' (the spread of fear, hatred and prejudice towards Muslims) (United Nations, 2025). The internet is being misused to make prejudice towards certain religions a 'trend' proving that the internet is being unfairly used to make more people biased against Muslims (United Nations, 2025). 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              The second reading by Maria Tataki and Dimitris Glynos focuses on the digital divide and how this divide became even wider due to the Covid pandemic in 2020 (Tataki and Glynos, 2020). When the Covid pandemic was still prevalent, many schools and students were forced to use an e-learning strategy; however, those who did not have the proper access to the internet were left out and could not receive their education through this method (Tataki and Glynos, 2020). The transition to online also had adverse effects on the lower income workers who do not have the luxury of being able to work from home (Tataki and Glynos, 2020). These workers faced the risk of losing their jobs during the pandemic due to the restrictions of social distancing (low-income workers usually perform jobs requiring a physical presence). The reading brings about a good point on why it is essential to bring internet access to all. The reading uses the Covid pandemic as a real world example which demonstrates the consequences of a lack of access to the internet.
