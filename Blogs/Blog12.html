              How code matters regarding Decolonialism
            </h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
              A means of reshaping the power dynamic within countries previously
              under a colonial structure is using technology and the digital
              world. To decolonise the technological space, our knowledge,
              methods, how we behave as well as what content we are exposed to
              needs to change to adhere to a structure which moves away from
              colonial systems.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Decolonialism influences the programming space through past norms
              which governed how the programming sector worked such as through
              the hiring norm of anti-social, white, male programmers.
              Algorithms should also adhere to a decolonial structure as this
              will introduce more progressive content to user's and can
              therefore bring more people out of a colonial mind-set. By
              continuing with norms such as this, the dynamic of power shifts
              once again towards a singular group of people reinforcing colonial
              systems within our modern world. Due to an unequal divide in
              technological resources, some countries inherit international
              methodologies which drive colonialism even further.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Keeping these points in mind, when I program an important note to
              remember is who am I coding for? When I program, I may
              involuntarily be representing other cultures and not necessarily
              my own such as through the current website I am developing which
              takes inspiration from cities. The cities I am drawing inspiration
              from come from developed, first-world countries and not
              necessarily my own city. From this perspective I can see that I am
              not currently representing my culture or the people of my country
              through my website but rather western society. Regarding software,
              I question the fact that almost every programming language
              incorporates the western English language which forces almost all
              programmers to learn their language to program. There should be
              more inclusion regarding programming languages to incorporate
              multiple languages spoken around the world to at least give people
              the option to use their own language when programming without
              being forced to use one.

            <h2 class="p-SubHeading">Development process with JavaScript</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
              JavaScript is an interesting addition to my website. The
              fundamentals of JavaScript (creating arrays, variables, functions
              etc.) are relatively straightforward, however JavaScript suddenly
              became very complex with regards to manipulating the DOM. Luckily,
              exercises are included which give us a good starting point with
              manipulating the DOM such as changing elements or adding to the
              HTML, populating pages easily, creating progressive counters,
              creating filters etc.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              I am working through the JavaScript exercises and then
              progressively adding to my website after I learn how to do
              something that I may want to incorporate into my website. The
              first thing which was recommended to do with JavaScript is create
              a 'hamburger' menu which will allow users to view and close the
              navigation links when pressing a button or icon. This was probably
              the easiest thing to do regarding JavaScript as it requires simply
              toggling the class in which the navigation links are contained. To
              add to this and create a sliding effect I added properties to my
              CSS file to make the 'hamburger' menu more interactive to use. The
              next thing I worked on was creating a system using JavaScript to
              more easily populate my blogs homepage. The current method I had
              using HTML directly required me to create the classes and
              containers each time I wanted to add a new blog card. Using
              JavaScript however, I can more easily populate this page as all I
              need to do is add the blog card details to an array in JavaScript
              to add that blog card to the page. Using the array to handle the
              blog cards also allowed me to more easily move between blog cards
              on a page (I have three cards displaying at a time and the user
              can press a button to move to the next section of blog cards). The
              next addition I made was tweaking the progress bar within the blog
              posts to make the progress bar grow dynamically when the user
              traverses the blog posts. I made use of a function from the
              exercises given known as setInterval(). This allowed me to
              dynamically grow the progress bar. I also added a feature which
              dynamically sets the width of the progress bar in the HTML using
              an array making populating my blog post HTML pages even easier to
              do.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              JavaScript makes HTML easier to work with through its ability to
              add directly to the HTML. Currently the JavaScript I included has
              made the website less static and feel more interactive already and
              I am quite excited to see how far I can go with JavaScript to make
              my website truly special.
