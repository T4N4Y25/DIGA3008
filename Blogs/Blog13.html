            <p class="paragraph">
              Throughout the course for Interactive Media, I have engaged in
              discussions and readings regarding ethics towards the internet. My
              interaction with the course has broadened my understanding on what
              it means to have an ethical internet.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              The introduction of the internet has brought with it many
              innovations towards our global economy by reducing economic
              friction regarding transport, communication and searching
              (Greenstein, 2018). The introduction of the internet has also
              brought about a greater separation of people through the digital
              divide in which unequal access to the internet has brought about a
              greater divide between regions and people. Additionally, the
              internet has made advancements in colonialism allowing power to
              shift towards certain regions or demographics. While the internet
              has had positive impacts on our society, the internet has
              unfortunately brought about its own set of problems which need to
              be addressed.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              The digital divide is the ever-growing gap between those who have
              access to ICT services and those who do not (TechTarget, 2024).
              With the world constantly moving towards a more digital era, those
              who lack access to the required resources fall further behind. The
              internet has innovated how we view information, distribution of
              goods and services, and how we can connect with each other further
              emphasising the need to bridge the digital divide to allow
              everyone to integrate and benefit from the digital era.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Practices need to be assessed regarding decolonizing the internet.
              The internet should be a place where people from different regions
              and background can thoroughly express themselves without being
              forced through a standard 'template'. The internet and programming
              in general should be more inclusive and represent people and
              cultures from every region of the world to avoid western society
              as being seen as the "norm". Steps are being taken to promote this
              such as through the google search engine supporting translation of
              languages, windows displaying beautiful scenery from different
              countries as wallpapers, and language accessibility becoming more
              standard. These are steps in the right direction, and I hope to
              see more being done to bridge the gap between different cultures
              and people, therefore putting an end to colonialist mindsets for
              good.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              To me an ethical internet is one where everyone has access to and
              can benefit from the web without restrictions based on location
              and economic state. An ethical internet is one that also promotes
              acceptance between different people from different backgrounds.
              The internet is a powerful resource and it should be used to help
              bridge the gap between people to create a truly unified world.
