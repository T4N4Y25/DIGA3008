              The reading done for this week is “Proposal for a Universal
              Electronic Publishing System and Archive” by Nelson, 2003. The
              article begins by exploring the initial concept of “Xandu”, a
              system which will allow people to create their own documents and
              can connect these documents with other public documents. “Xandu”
              is therefore proposed to be the “ultimate archive”. With the
              introduction of the Web, “Xandu” can be implemented with more
              possibilities being explored. The initial vision explored the idea
              of paying for your information to make the system beneficial for
              companies and to attempt to prevent the misuse of information. The
              article continues to build upon the idea of evolving the way we
              view modern literature and knowledge and how this can be
              implemented using the Web.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
              Upon finishing the article, I couldn’t help but imagine Nelson’s
              reaction to the modern-day Web. The vision of “Xandu” has been
              implemented and more has come about in a short period of time. It
              is fascinating to see just how rapidly the Web has evolved as it
              now makes information freely available to the public and it is so
              deeply incorporated into society as we know it. The Web is now
              used to connect individuals in a way that wasn’t even thought of
              back when Nelson first came up with “Xandu”. Seeing this I can’t
              even imagine how much more the Web will grow and evolve further
              than what we think in the coming years.

              Setting up GitHub and publishing to pages
            </h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Setting up GitHub was straightforward as we had incorporated
              GitHub in our projects throughout 2024. This was mostly done with
              Unity and C# so utilizing html files with Visual Studio Code was
              new to me, however the process of setting up html projects in
              GitHub is considerably easier than with Unity.

          <section class="HistoryParagraph">
            <h2 class="p-SubHeading">History of the Web</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
              It is interesting to see the initial vision for the Web as a
              method to share information with older concepts such as film
              splicing used. Looking at the Web’s history it is interesting to
              finally see how the idea of the Web steadily evolved into what it
              is today with different people incorporating their own vision for
              it.

            <p class="paragraph">
              I hope to take advantage of this course to fully understand how to
              utilize the Web to my advantage. I wish to be able to learn how to
              build and manage a website as this will allow me to widen my
              opportunities and build upon my portfolio.
