<h1> Week 1 (10/02/2025 – 14/02/2025) </h1>
<body>
    <p>
    The reading done for this week is “Proposal for a Universal Electronic Publishing System and Archive” by Nelson, 2003.
The article begins by exploring the initial concept of “Xandu”, a system which will allow people to create their own documents and can connect these documents with other public documents. “Xandu” is therefore proposed to be the “ultimate archive”. With the introduction of the Web, “Xandu” can be implemented with more possibilities being explored. The initial vision explored the idea of paying for your information to make the system beneficial for companies and to attempt to prevent the misuse of information. The article continues to build upon the idea of evolving the way we view modern literature and knowledge and how this can be implemented using the Web.

Upon finishing the article, I couldn’t help but imagine Nelson’s reaction to the modern-day Web. The vision of “Xandu” has been implemented and more has come about in a short period of time. It is fascinating to see just how rapidly the Web has evolved as it now makes information freely available to the public and it is so deeply incorporated into society as we know it. The Web is now used to connect individuals in a way that wasn’t even thought of back when Nelson first came up with “Xandu”. Seeing this I can’t even imagine how much more the Web will grow and evolve further than what we think in the coming years.

<h2> Setting up GitHub and publishing to pages</h2>
<p>
    Setting up GitHub was straightforward as we had incorporated GitHub in our projects throughout 2024. This was mostly done with Unity and C# so utilizing html files with Visual Studio Code was new to me, however the process of setting up html projects in GitHub is considerably easier than with Unity.
</p>

<h2> History of the Web</h2>
<p>
    It is interesting to see the initial vision for the Web as a method to share information with older concepts such as film splicing used. Looking at the Web’s history it is interesting to finally see how the idea of the Web steadily evolved into what it is today with different people incorporating their own vision for it. 
</p>

<h2>Course Goals</h2>
<p>
    I hope to take advantage of this course to fully understand how to utilize the Web to my advantage. I wish to be able to learn how to build and manage a website as this will allow me to widen my opportunities and build upon my portfolio.
