            The Ethics in the Interaction Design of the Woolworths Website
          </h2>
        </div>
        <article class="essayContent">
          <p class="essayParagraph">
            Interaction design relates to more than just how the user interacts
            with a website; interaction design can influence a user’s mentality,
            their feelings and can affect how the user interacts with the
            website (Aparna K S, 2024). Woolworths promotes ethical design
            principles in its implementation of the Woolworths website
            (Woolworths, n.d.). The points that will be discussed relating to
            the idea that Woolworths promotes ethical design principles are an
            analysis of the UI and UX implemented into the website, and various
            principles of ethical design seen on the website.
          </p>
          <p class="essayParagraph">
            The website consists of a very familiar design for a website in the
            retail industry demonstrating good UI principles (familiarity).
            Familiar designs increase the usability of a website as they are
            more easily understood hence increasing user engagement with the
            website (Dewra, 2023). The navigation bar consists of a search bar,
            a delivery address and a checkout basket icon; these elements are
            very common in the navigation bar for retail websites such as the
            websites for Mr Price (Mr Price, n.d.) and Game (Game, n.d.). The
            main content of the homepage then follows a similar structure to
            other websites as large images showcasing certain products appear
            first with the additional options being found in the footer of the
            page. By utilizing a familiar structure for the website, users are
            more comfortable which results in good ethics being displayed.
          </p>
          <p class="essayParagraph">
            The Woolworths website demonstrates a good information hierarchy
            which coincides with good UI practices. By incorporating a good
            information hierarchy into a website’s design, the website can
            emphasise important information or elements while also guiding the
            user naturally through the website. The “rule of thirds” splits the
            website into four distinct sections each having an important
            function (Webflow, n.d.). The top-right section contains the main
            logo for Woolworths with all the relevant navigation options
            presented to the user. The top-left section contains the important
            functions for the user as this section has the search bar, the
            shopping cart, sign in options and the delivery address for the
            website. The top section therefore gives the user a good
            understanding of the website without being overwhelming and
            providing the user with the relevant tools to utilize the website.
            The next section makes up most of the website’s homepage. This
            section advertises different products that Woolworths is offering.
            The final third contains all the relevant links for the website. As
            there are numerous links found here, the user is not overwhelmed by
            the amount of information presented as they will be naturally guided
            to this section last. The colour palette selected consists of white
            and black which has good contrast and is reminiscent of the
            Woolworths brand. The font remains consistent with bold only being
            used for the Woolworths logo. There is minimal negative space as
            sections where negative space could be applied is smartly filled
            using images and store options relevant to the website. By
            implementing a good information hierarchy, the website can make use
            of the user’s “common sense” to guide the user through the website
            (Smith, 2019).
          </p>
          <p class="essayParagraph">
            The similarity effect is utilized in a smart way on the Woolworths
            website to group together related items and sections (Yablonski,
            n.d.). By grouping items this way, there is visual consistency on
            the website and the website naturally become more intuitive which a
            fundamental in UX design. The navigation bar in the header of the
            website consists primarily of text with white space, defining the
            navigation bar for the user which utilizes the elements proximity
            and similarity as a grouping feature (Yablonski, n.d.). The main
            body primarily consists of images laid out in-line followed by a
            grid layout presenting further options. The layout of the body hence
            groups the main items on display by displaying them in-line, with
            the further options to explore laid out in a grid only after the
            main items are displayed. The footer consists of links and options
            being displayed in a grid format with normal text and white space.
            This groups the footer and header together, but the footer remains
            distinguished from the header due to the arrangement of the footer
            (in a grid) compared to the header (more in-line). By grouping
            together elements using the similarity effect, the website naturally
            becomes more intuitive increasing the usability of the website and
            hence making the websites design more ethical (Ghanchi, 2021).
          </p>
          <p class="essayParagraph">
            Fitt’s law (“the time to acquire a target is a function of the
            distance to and size of the target”) (Yablonski, n.d.) is correctly
            implemented in the Woolworth’s website through it’s use of large
            icons and a navigation that remains consistently at the top of the
            page. By reducing the time complexity to complete tasks within a
            website, the user is more influenced to interact with the website;
            however, these persuasion tactics can be seen as unethical due to
            the influence on the user to purchase more items they would not have
            necessarily bought (Ghanchi, 2021). The icons showcasing the items
            on display are large (such as the images) and the smaller icons are
            well-spaced making them easier to acquire (Yablonski, n.d.). The
            mobile version of the Woolworths website has a navigation bar which
            remains consistent (at the top of the page) when the user scrolls
            through the website, often referred to as a “sticky navigation”
            (Chichioco, 2019). The use of a sticky navigation is seen to save
            the user ample time when browsing through the website with research
            showing that the implementation of a sticky navigation can save user
            “thirty-six seconds within a five-minute viewing of the website”
            (Chichioco, 2019). The navigation bar holds important functions for
            the website such as the general navigation and access to the user’s
            shopping cart. The implementation of large, interactable icons and a
            sticky navigation bar (on the mobile version of the website) helps
            reduce the time complexity when interacting with the website but due
            to the retail nature of the site, this implementation is aimed to
            influence the user to make more purchases. Therefore, the website
            borders between ethical and unethical in this regard as the
            usability is increased but the influence on the user can be seen as
            unethical (Ghanchi, 2021).
          </p>
          <p class="essayParagraph">
            The shopping cart in the navigation bar of the website and the
            multiple sign-in prompts utilizes the Zeigarnik effect (“people
            remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed
            tasks”) (Yablonski, n.d.). The use of the Zeigarnik effect plays
            into influence regarding UX ethical practices as the user is
            promoted to finish their purchases and are encouraged to sign-in to
            a Woolworths account. The shopping cart has a red icon displaying
            the number of items the user has selected to purchase. The use of
            red creates a visual contrast between the normal white and black
            colour palette which makes the user remember this element when
            browsing through the site. Sign-in options for the user primarily
            utilizes the serial position effect due to its placement in both the
            header and the footer (the first and last items seen are remembered)
            (Yablonski, n.d.). The option to create a Woolworths account is
            placed in both the beginning and end of the website which allows the
            user to be introduced to the concept of creating an account and are
            then reminded at the end of the page that they can make an account
            (an uncompleted task hence incorporating the Zeigarnik effect). By
            utilizing the Zeigarnik effect and aspects of the serial position
            effect, the website creates emphasis on the user’s shopping cart as
            well as the option to create an account. This creates a clear
            influence on the user which can be seen on the border of “white-hat”
            and “grey-hat” persuasion (Ghanchi, 2021). The user is prompted to
            complete purchases due to the constant indication that they have
            items in their shopping cart which can be seen as unethical;
            however, the user is encouraged to create an account which can help
            support the Woolworth’s brand while also potentially giving the user
            discounts on certain items which is an ethical practice.
          </p>
          <p class="essayParagraph">
            The Woolworth’s website demonstrates transparency in how they are
            handling the user’s information using cookies. Cookies are used by
            websites to remember information regarding the user’s visits to
            create a more personalized experience for the user upon their next
            visit such as by displaying more content that the user will find
            interesting (Google, n.d.). To do this the website needs to remember
            how the user has interacted with the site beforehand which can be
            seen as an invasion of privacy. Woolworth’s takes the correct
            approach by creating a pop-up asking the user for consent regarding
            the cookies system. The cookies pop-up vaguely explains the use of
            the cookies for the website with a large black icon displaying
            “accept”. A link to the privacy policy is then included so user’s
            have the option to see how their information on the website is being
            handled. The cookies pop-up, however, only has the option to accept
            the cookies which is emphasised with its large font and black
            border. This can be seen as a method to reduce the time complexity
            of accepting the cookies as cookies are commonly used in most
            websites so user’s will most likely already be accustomed to their
            use. There is no option to decline the cookies giving user’s
            seemingly no other option but to accept them. While the Woolworths
            website demonstrates transparency regarding its use of cookies, the
            user is however persuaded to accept the cookies through it’s
            emphasised “accept” icon and the lack of option to decline the use
            of cookies. The Woolworths website therefore demonstrates good
            ethical practices through transparency (Gada, 2025) but does cross
            into the “grey hat” boundary of UX ethics through it’s use of
            influence (Ghanchi, 2021).
          </p>
          <p class="essayParagraph">
            The Woolworths website keeps the user safe with a good level of
            security for sensitive information. Safety and security are
            fundamental to good UX ethics to prevent sensitive information from
            being distributed to malicious individuals. Woolworths shows
            transparency by explaining in detail how the user’s information,
            such as their banking card details, are being protected. Woolworth’s
            utilizes SSL keys (Woolworths, n.d.) to encrypt the user’s
            information; additionally, Woolworths encourages the user to use “3D
            secure” to further protect their data and privacy (Woolworths,
            n.d.). By creating an emphasis on security through incorporating
            multiple security methods (SSL keys and “3D secure”), Woolworths
            demonstrates good standards regarding safety and security while
            additionally being transparent with the user by explaining how this
            is being done. These practices help ensure ethical practices are
            maintained throughout the website when sensitive information is
            involved.
          </p>
          <p class="essayParagraph">
            Woolworths actively promotes sustainable practices in their website
            creating “sustainable user conduct” (Ghanchi, 2021). Sustainable
            practices are important elements to incorporate into websites to
            promote better use of natural resources and the environment
            (Ghanchi, 2021). Woolworths promotes their sustainable practices on
            their website with icons and images designated specifically to
            highlight this information, often seen as “our good business
            journey” (Woolworths, n.d.). Woolworths does not financially benefit
            from promoting this as the website could instead further show their
            products. Woolworths therefore promotes ethical practices by
            encouraging sustainability.
          </p>
          <p class="essayParagraph">
            The Woolworths website has good ethical practices throughout its
            interaction design. The structure of the UI and UX promotes comfort
            and is intuitive to use. The website also demonstrates transparency
            with the use of cookies as well as transparency in the application
            of safety and security. Woolworths is however a retail brand, and
            the purpose of the website is to sell products to the user;
            therefore, the use of influence techniques can border between “white
            hat” and “grey hat” (Ghanchi, 2021) when influencing a user to
            accept the website cookies, promoting purchases or getting the user
            to sign up for a Woolworths account. Woolworths actively encourages
            sustainable practices which is rare to see in modern websites.
            Overall Woolworths has good ethics in the structure of the
            interaction design.

            The internet is a space which has provided numerous benefits to
            society through improving communication, searching as well as
            transportation (Greenstein, 2018). However, due to the introduction
            of the internet, geopolitics has become more advanced with
            international relations now intersecting with internet usage. The
            internet has also allowed a progression of digital coloniality in
            which Western society norms become more dominant throughout the
            world. A recent example of the internet being used in geopolitics
            and the promotion of digital coloniality, is the ban of TikTok, a
            popular social media app, by the United States (Miller, 2025). The
            aim of this essay is to explore the implications of the TikTok ban
            regarding geopolitics (primarily between the United States and
            China), what this ban means regarding digital coloniality, prior
            consequences of the TikTok ban, and how the internet has been used
            to link geopolitics and digital coloniality.

            Since around 1990, China has steadily grown into an economic power
            that can compete with the United States (Starrs, 2025). China has
            rapidly established its economic presence through the manufacturing
            of cheap goods, vehicles, smartphones, solar panels and especially
            social media (Starrs, 2025). According to surveys, approximately
            ninety-eight percent of American citizens have access to or own a
            smartphone (Pew Research Center, 2024). TikTok is a social media
            developed by ByteDance, a company based in China, and has become one
            of the most popular social medias even surpassing almost all other
            social media downloads in 2019 (Zhang, 2024). With the increasing
            rise in TikTok’s popularity and the large access to smartphones seen
            in the United States, concerns began to rise regarding the safety
            and privacy of users with claims stating that TikTok is being used
            to monitor and observe their users and if given the chance,
            ByteDance may give this information to the Chinese government
            (Lutkevich, 2025). The United State’s fear for national security has
            led to the divest-or ban law which requires ByteDance to sell TikTok
            to the United States or face a permanent ban (Miller, 2025). As seen
            through the banning of TikTok, a social media which is mainly used
            to deliver content, became implicit in the geopolitical relations
            between the United States and China due to fear of China misusing
            the user data of US citizens.

            The controversy surrounding TikTok’s collection of data relates to
            digital coloniality. Data is now seen as a new resource which can be
            used for data capitalism as well as data colonialism (Shakir, 2020).
            In the past, colonialism exploited land, labour and international
            relations and there was no concern over those being exploited
            (Shakir, 2020). In the modern era, this exploitation has translated
            towards the digital era and is seen as digital coloniality. By
            collecting data on users, the user themselves becomes insignificant
            and only their data has relevance (Shakir, 2020). Additionally, the
            act of the United States attempting to buy TikTok from China
            demonstrates a power struggle between the two countries which
            relates to a colonial framework in which the country with the
            technology (known as metropoles in this framework) is seen as having
            technological power over the periphery (society and consumers are
            the periphery in this framework) (Shakir, 2020). Using this
            framework as a lens, the United States can be seen as attempting to
            seize technological power away from China through the purchase of
            TikTok.

            The TikTok ban can be seen happening in other countries due to
            geopolitical conflict such as in India. Prior to 2020, India was the
            largest market for TikTok (BBC Future, 2024). Both China and India
            wanted control of the border within the Himalayan region to build
            infrastructure within this region (BBC News, 2022). Unfortunately,
            in 2020 tensions between the two countries lead to a violent
            confrontation between the two countries (BBC News, 2022). Following
            the violent confrontation, India proceeded to immediately ban
            TikTok. The reason given was that Chinese apps threatened the
            countries “sovereignty and security” (Dozier, 2023). Despite the ban
            in India, all content previously created by the people in India has
            been kept on TikTok, allowing China to continue profiting from this
            content despite the banning in India (BBC Future, 2024). The banning
            of TikTok had a negative consequence to the people of India. TikTok
            provided a platform for the rural communities to gain a following
            and even profit from it (BBC Future, 2024). There were also positive
            consequences as the removal of TikTok allowed companies, within
            India, to attempt to reproduce their own popular social media
            allowing their country to profit from it instead of China (BBC
            Future, 2024). By banning TikTok, India regressed digital
            coloniality set by China as the ban stopped a foreign power from
            profiting from the user’s data. By examining this event, a
            connection is made between the hostilities between the countries and
            the subsequent banning of the app.

          <p class="essayParagraph">
            Through examining the consequences of the ban of TikTok in India,
            similar events could happen within the United States. India was a
            large market for TikTok to profit from, but TikTok also provided
            opportunities to India’s rural communities by providing a platform
            and audience that the communities could profit from (BBC Future,
            2024). Similarly, within the United States, the banning of TikTok
            could remove opportunities from the rural communities. The United
            States will allow TikTok to remain active in the country if the
            company, ByteDance, sells the social media rights to them (Miller,
            2025). By purchasing TikTok, the social media platform can continue
            to benefit the rural communities without profiting a foreign power;
            hence regressing digital coloniality. If the social media does get
            banned, other social medias originating from the United States will
            gain an opportunity to thrive within the country further promoting
            digital decoloniality (a foreign country will no longer be able to
            exploit user’s data).
          </p>
          <p class="essayParagraph">
            The TikTok ban seen in the United States is a clear example of how
            the internet can be used to intersect geopolitics and digital
            coloniality. China’s rise as an economic competitor to the United
            States instigated a fear that China was misusing the popularity of
            TikTok to collect information from its users. A user’s data being
            exploited is a form of digital coloniality and the ban of TikTok is
            seen as an attempt to gain control of this resource from China. The
            prior conflict between India and China which lead to the subsequent
            banning of TikTok, and all other Chinese social media is a past
            example of how the internet is used in hostilities between nations.
            The social media app, TikTok was used in geopolitics as well as
            digital coloniality and the subsequent banning of this app could
            help alleviate tensions between the nations as well as reducing the
            hold of digital coloniality.
